title: Controller
---

I've created a version of the make:controller command which automatically adds the MaterialDashboard style to the controller. You can use it as follows:

```
php bin/console material-dashboard:make:controller
```

You use it the same way you'd use the regular MakerBundle make:controller command, just follow the wizard and you'll have your styled Controllers ready in no time.
