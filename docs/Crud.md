title: Crud
---

The idea of the Material Dashboard Bundle is that you focus on your code instead of the styling of the screens so I adapted the MakerBundle make:crud command to create styled crud interfaces, so you no longer have to do it yourself.

You can access my version of the command by doing:

```
php bin/console material-dashboard:make:crud
```

You use it the same way you'd use the regular MakerBundle make:crud command, just follow the wizard and you'll have your styled CRUD interfaces ready in no time.
