<p>The idea of the Material Dashboard Bundle is that you focus on your code instead of the styling of the screens so I adapted the MakerBundle make:crud command to create styled crud interfaces, so you no longer have to do it yourself.</p>

<p>You can access my version of the command by doing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>php bin/console material-dashboard:make:crud
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You use it the same way you’d use the regular MakerBundle make:crud command, just follow the wizard and you’ll have your styled CRUD interfaces ready in no time.</p>
